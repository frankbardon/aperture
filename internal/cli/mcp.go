// (storage -> engine -> service) and serves Aperture's READ-ONLY MCP surface over
// stdio — the transport an MCP client uses when it spawns Aperture as a
// subprocess. The surface is read/decide/simulate/inspect only; no mutating tool
// exists, so the command wires the facade with storage (for inspection + what-if
// reads) but NOT the gate / delegation / impersonation mutators.
//
// The CLI stays thin: it builds the graph, constructs the go-sdk server, mounts
// the SDK-free catalog through the single gosdk adapter, and runs the transport.
// All tool logic lives in the mcp/ core; the binary entrypoint (cmd/aperture)
// only assembles the command tree.

// answer differently from every other surface: no rule evaluator, no object
// lister, and — once the metadata filter landed — no metadata source, so an
// aperture_enumerate carrying `Fields` could only report
// APERTURE_PROVIDER_UNREGISTERED however well the seed declared its objects.
//
// cmd is the parsed `aperture mcp` command, read for the shared decision
// configuration the whole binary honours (today --enumerate-limit).
//
// warnings receives the seed's provider/objects collision report. stdout is the
// MCP transport, so the caller passes stderr.
//
// The stack is returned alongside the facade because it OWNS resources — the
// seed's database pools — and the facade does not: something has to outlive this
// call to close them. Callers defer stack.Close().
