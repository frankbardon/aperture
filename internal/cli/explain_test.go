// prove it is NON-LOSSY is to prove the printed bytes are that rendering, whole.
// A test that only looked for a notes section would pass just as happily against
// a CLI that hand-picked a few trace fields; this one fails the moment the
// command starts projecting the trace onto a subset, whatever the field.
