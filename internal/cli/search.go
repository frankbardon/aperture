// searchCommand is `aperture search <principal> <action> <pattern> <query>`: it
// ranks the objects a principal may act on by how well their metadata matches
// free text — the name→id lookup a surface that takes input in a person's own
// words has to do before it can ask anything else.
//
// It is the operator's way to see exactly what a host's search call would see,
// which is the diagnosis "did my rename land?" needs and the one an operator
// cannot otherwise get: the library answer and the CLI answer come off the same
// facade, so they cannot disagree.

			"Matching is case- and punctuation-insensitive (\"Nike, Inc.\" matches \"nike inc\") and\n" +
			"tolerates a typo or a transposition on tokens long enough for one to be unambiguous.\n" +
			"Only TEXT is matched — a string field and the string elements of a list field. Match\n" +
			"a number, bool, or date with --field instead.\n\n" +
			"Aperture has no notion of a \"label\": a label is an ordinary metadata field whose name\n" +

			"--field / --fields-json and --via mean exactly what they mean on `enumerate`, and they\n" +
			"COMPOSE with the query: the predicate and the reference edge narrow the candidate set,\n" +
			"the query ranks what is left. \"The brand called Nike in dataset X\" is one call.\n\n" +
			"--min-score drops weak matches (default " + strconv.FormatFloat(provider.DefaultMinScore, 'g', -1, 64) + "). Raising it narrows the shortlist; it\n" +
			"never widens what the principal may see.\n\n" +
