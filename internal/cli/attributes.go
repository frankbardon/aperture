// `aperture attributes` — the operator's window onto the attribute directories.
//
// Three subcommands, and they are deliberately not equals:
//
//	slots       what this deployment WIRES: which slots have a source, what kind
//	            it is, and how each slot's cache is tuned. No key, no bag.
//	query       a page OF a directory. The system-tier admin read, gated.
//	invalidate  drop cached bags so the next decision re-reads them. Gated.
//
// The CLI is the only surface this effort adds — there is no RPC method and no
// MCP tool for any of it. That is a scope decision with a reason: MCP is the
// surface where an agent listing a host's entire user table is least defensible,
// and a directory read is exactly the shape of request that should require a
// human at a shell with the deployment's seed file in hand.
//
// # Why `slots` is ungated and the other two are not
//
// `query` and `invalidate` go through the facade, which runs
// service.requireAttributeAdmin: the surface must be wired, the caller
// authenticated, and the caller a system-admin in its active account. The gate
// runs BEFORE the slot name is parsed, so a refused caller cannot learn which
// slots this deployment wires by reading which error came back.
//
// `slots` takes no actor and asks nothing of the gate, because it discloses
// nothing a caller did not already supply. It reads the SEED FILE the operator
// named on the command line and the cache configuration this process built from
// it; the answer is a restatement of the operator's own input, and requiring
// system-admin authority to read back a file you just passed in would only mean
// nobody could diagnose "is the user slot even wired?" without also holding the
// authority the diagnosis exists to explain. It never touches a provider, never
// names a key, and never prints a bag.

// attributeStack builds the decision stack the attribute commands read through,
// plus the cleanup that releases it. It is the SAME builder every other command
// uses, so the slots a listing reports are the slots a decision resolves through
// — the CLI cannot describe a wiring it does not itself run.
