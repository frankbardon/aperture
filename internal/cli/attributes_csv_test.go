// attributeSeed (attributes_test.go) proves the same shape for the INLINE
// section. This one changes exactly one thing — where the bags come from — and
// keeps the rest identical, because that is the claim: an attribute_providers:
// entry is another source for the same seam, not another seam.
//
// Two files, because the slot dispatch is part of what is being proven: a human
// principal is answered out of users.csv and a machine out of machines.csv. A
// build that served both from one directory, or that ignored kind entirely,
// fails on ci-runner.
