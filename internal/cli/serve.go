// usage text names the matching variable. urfave/cli parses a boolean source
// itself and fails the command with its own uncoded "parse error" before the
// action ever runs, which would make a typo'd APERTURE_MANAGE_ACCOUNTS report
// something other than APERTURE_CONFIG_INVALID. Reading the environment through
// service.ManagedEntitiesFromEnv keeps one coded error for a bad value, and
// keeps cmd.IsSet meaning "the operator typed this flag" so flag-over-env
// precedence is unambiguous. Both paths accept strconv.ParseBool's spellings, so
// the two can never disagree about a value they both accept.
//
// --enumerate-limit makes the opposite trade against the same hazard: it KEEPS
// its EnvVars source, because a string source has no parse for urfave to fail,
// and does the number parsing itself. See enumerateLimit in enumerate_limit.go.
