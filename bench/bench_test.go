// PARTITIONED, not multiplied — R rounds of n/R Checks is the same total work the
// single contiguous run did — and each assertion is made against the BEST round:
// the fastest rate for throughput, the lowest percentile for p99.
//
// WHAT IT BUYS. Contention on a shared machine is one-sided: it only ever makes a
// window slower, never faster. Measured as one contiguous window, pressure
// anywhere in that window drags the whole average under the floor, and the gate
// reports a number about the machine rather than about Aperture. E3-S2 reproduced
// exactly that on a clean tree with this effort's changes stashed — at load
// average ~19-24 the absolute-threshold halves returned 6 474-9 990 checks/sec
// against a 10 000 floor, with DIFFERENT subtests failing each run, which is the
// signature of load flake rather than a regression. Split into rounds, the
// contended windows cost their own rounds and the best round still reports what
// the machinery costs when it has a core, which is the quantity FR-31 is about.
// It is the same reasoning, and the same remedy, as the minimum-over-rounds in
// TestCheckNFREnumerateBound — the difference being that this gate asserts an
// absolute target from the PRD and so cannot divide machine speed out with a
// ratio the way that one does.
//
// WHY TWO NUMBERS. They are the same remedy at the granularity each statistic can
// take. Throughput is a RATE: a round only has to be long enough to time
// meaningfully, so the gate takes MANY SHORT rounds — the more windows it looks
// at, and the shorter each one is, the likelier one of them ran on an uncontended
// core. p99 is a PERCENTILE: a round has to carry enough samples for the 99th to
// mean anything, so it takes FEWER, LARGER rounds. Splitting p99 as finely as
// throughput would trade the noise it is meant to reject for noise in the
// estimator itself. At the smallest budget in use (variantSamples), a throughput
// round is 400 Checks (~30 ms of work) and a p99 round is 2 000 samples, leaving
// 20 above the 99th percentile.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS. A real regression that is uniform — every window slower — still
// fails, because every round misses the target. What now passes is a regression
// that is INTERMITTENT in exactly the shape load noise has: slow in most windows,
// fine in one. That is the deliberate trade, and it is the right way round for a
// gate whose target is a steady-state rate: a gate that cries wolf on a loaded
// laptop gets disabled, and a disabled gate catches nothing at any threshold.
//
// The thresholds themselves are untouched. This is a fix to the MEASUREMENT; the
// target it measures against is still the PRD's.
