//
// A resolver returns ONLY what the host knows. It does not need to publish `id`

//
// kind is model.PrincipalKind's spelling — "user" or "machine" — passed as a

// registry are rarely the same store) without re-deriving the kind from the id.
// An empty kind means the caller did not have the principal's record in hand: a
// resolver treats that as unknown, and must not substitute a default kind, or a

// AccountResolver supplies the ACTIVE account's attribute bag for the evaluation

// is treated as read-only, transitively — the engine copies it rather than
// writing into it, and no other holder writes to it at any depth.
//
// Like PrincipalResolver it returns ONLY what the host knows: the `id` a rule
// reads off `account` is the engine's floor, stamped over whatever comes back
// (see accountBag), so a resolver that returns nil is not an error and not an
// empty `account` — it is the floor.
//
// # Why the method is not called Attributes
//
// So that ONE type can satisfy both seams. A *provider.AttributeRegistry serves
// the principal slots and the account slot, and Go has no overloading: reusing
// the name would force a host to wire two objects, or to wrap one, where the
// registry already holds both directories and both caches. The distinct name is
// what keeps `rules.WithPrincipalResolver(reg)` and
// `rules.WithAccountResolver(reg)` the same reg.
//
// # The wildcard is not an account
//
// account is a concrete account id. The account wildcard "*" never reaches a
// resolver — the engine resolves it to the floor without consulting one (see
// Engine.accountAttributes) — so an implementation never has to decide what
// "the attributes of every account" would mean.

// accountWildcard is model.AccountWildcard ("*") spelled as a literal, because
// rules imports no model — the same reason provider spells it out in
// attribute.go.
//
// It is a grant/membership SENTINEL meaning "every account", never an account
// that exists: model.ValidateAccount refuses to store a row under it. A decision
// can still be made with it as the active account — that is how platform-tier
// authority is anchored — and what `account` means there is handled in
// Engine.accountAttributes.
const accountWildcard = "*"

// accountBag builds the `account` root: a FRESH map holding the resolver's
// attributes with the floor — the account id — stamped over them.
//
// # Why the floor is {id} and not {id, kind}
//
// `principal` publishes a kind because attribute providers are registered per
// principal kind, so which directory answered is a fact a rule author needs in
// order to state a rule's dependence on it. An account has no such fact: there
// is one account slot, it answers for every account, and a `kind` key would be
// the same constant in every bag in every deployment — a value that can never
// discriminate is not information, it is noise a rule author would eventually
// write a comparison against.
//
// What remains is `id`, and it earns its place for the reason the floor exists
// at all: it is the part of `account` that does not depend on what the host
// happened to configure, so `account.id == "acme"` is writable against ANY
// deployment, wired or not.
//
// # Why the floor wins on collision
//
// The floor is stamped LAST, exactly as principalBag does it and for the same
// reason. A host's account table with its own internal `id` column is an
// ordinary accident, not an attack; if it could shadow the floor then
// `account.id == object.account` would silently start comparing a surrogate key
// against an account id and the rule would answer a different question with no
// error anywhere. A floor that can be shadowed is not a floor.
//
// # Why a fresh map
//
// bag may be a cached attribute bag shared across every object in this decision
// and every concurrent decision in the same account — which, for the account
// slot, is every decision the tenant is making at once. Stamping into it would
// be a write through a read-only value at the widest blast radius Aperture has.

// principalBag builds the `principal` root: a FRESH map holding the resolver's
// attributes with the floor — id and kind — stamped over them.
//
// # Why the floor is the engine's job, not the resolver's
//
// Every resolver gets it, including a host's own. A rule author can therefore
// write principal.id and principal.kind against ANY deployment, wired or not,
// which is the whole point of a floor: it is the part of `principal` that does
// not depend on what the host happened to configure.
//
// # Why `kind` is published at all
//
// Attribute providers are registered PER KIND, so a rule that reads a user
// directory's field is silently kind-dependent: for a machine principal that
// field is simply absent and the comparison is false. In an inclusive grant that
// is deny-safe; in an EXCLUSIVE one — where selection means "excluded" — a rule
// that quietly stops selecting WIDENS access. principal.kind is the tool an
// author needs to say which kinds a rule is about, so
// `principal.kind == "user" && principal.tier == "gold"` states the dependence
// instead of hiding it.
//
// # Why the floor wins on collision
//
// The floor is stamped LAST, so a host bag carrying its own "id" or "kind" key
// cannot shadow it. Not primarily as a defence — a directory is host-trusted
// infrastructure — but because the realistic collision is innocent: a directory
// with its own internal `id` column would silently redefine what
// `principal.id == object.owner` compares, and an ownership rule would start
// answering a different question with no error anywhere. A floor that can be
// shadowed is not a floor.
//
// # Why a fresh map
//
// bag may be a cached attribute bag, shared across every object in this decision
// and every concurrent decision for the same principal. Stamping into it would
// be a write through a read-only value at the widest blast radius Aperture has.

}

// recordFloorOnly notes each attribute root that THIS rule reads a host-defined
// field off and that resolved to NOTHING but the engine's floor — so a rule
// written against `principal.tier` says the tier was never there, instead of
// merely failing to select.
//
// The bags are the RESOLVERS' answers, before principalBag/accountBag stamp the
// floor into them, which is what makes "floor-only" a plain emptiness check: an
// empty resolver bag is exactly a root that carries the floor alone.
//
// # Why the rule's own paths gate it
//
// A note is only worth recording where the hazard exists. A rule that reads
// nothing but `object.*`, or nothing but `principal.id`, is unaffected by an
// unwired directory: the floor is always there and it always says the same
// thing. Recording a floor-only note for those rules would put two lines on
// every trace of every rule-backed grant in the very common deployment that
// wires no attribute provider at all, and the traces where the note MATTERS
// would be the ones nobody could find.
//
// The gate is on what the rule NAMES, not on what a comparison did, and that is
// the deliberate half. `principal.tier == "contractor"` earns the note whether
// the comparison was reached, short-circuited away by an && to its left, or
// evaluated and found false — because in every one of those cases the operator
// reading the trace is looking at a rule whose author expected a field the
// deployment did not supply.
//
// It is called only from the collector branch of Selected, so the AST walk — and
// the note — cost Check and Enumerate nothing.
//
// THE ACCOUNT WILDCARD LANDS HERE TOO, and truthfully. A decision made at
// platform scope resolves no account bag at all (see Engine.accountAttributes:
// "*" is not an account and never reaches a resolver), so a rule reading
// `account.plan` there really is comparing against nothing, which is worth
// saying out loud for the same reason an unwired slot is.
