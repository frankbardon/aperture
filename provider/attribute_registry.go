// AttributeRegistry maps each of the three attribute slots to its
// AttributeProvider plus a per-slot bag cache. It is the seam the engine and
// rules layers resolve a decision's principal and account attributes through.
// It is safe for concurrent use: providers are registered at startup and read on
// the hot path under an RWMutex, and each per-slot cache is independently
// concurrency-safe.
//
// # It is NOT an object lister, and that is a property of the type
//
// A *Registry deliberately satisfies the scope.ObjectLister contract, so it can
// be handed straight to a scope resolver as the thing that enumerates "all
// objects of a type". An *AttributeRegistry deliberately does NOT, and there is
// no compile-time assertion here to match registry.go's precisely because the
// assertion is the thing being refused.
//
// The reason is not tidiness. A scope resolver enumerating through an
// ObjectLister is answering "which objects does this grant reach?" mid-decision.
// If the principal directory were reachable through that seam, the principal
// table would become an enumerable object set inside a decision — every
// principal in the deployment listable by anything holding a lister, with the
// grant's own scope as the only bound, and no admin tier consulted. Attribute
// enumeration is a system-tier admin read; it is not a scope-resolution source.
//
// Go's typing is STRUCTURAL, so intending that is worth nothing. A method that
// happens to be spelled List(ctx, string, identity.Pattern, int)
// ([]identity.Identity, error) satisfies scope.ObjectLister whether or not
// anybody meant it to, and the wiring mistake it enables is silent — the
// resolver compiles, runs, and enumerates. Containment is therefore structural
// too:
//
//   - enumeration is called Enumerate, not List;
//   - it is keyed by an AttributeSlot, not a bare object-type string;
//   - it takes an AttributeFilter, which has no identity.Pattern to bound with
//     (see AttributeFilter);
//   - it returns []AttributeRecord — bare string keys — not
//     []identity.Identity.
//
// Any one of those makes the signature unassignable; all four make it
// unassignable by accident. TestAttributeRegistryIsNotAScopeLister asserts the
// negative against the real scope.ObjectLister interface, so the guarantee
// cannot rot into a comment.

//
// The slot's cache is FETCH's cache — the decision path's view of a subject. An
// enumeration's bags are Query's answer, and nothing in the AttributeProvider
// contract says Query returns the same bag Fetch does. The SQL loader makes the
// divergence explicit and legal: AttributeConfig.ListQuery is OPTIONAL and is
// only required to select a bare id, so
//
//	get_one: SELECT department, clearance, to_jsonb(teams) AS teams FROM users WHERE id = $1
//	get_all: SELECT u.id AS id, u.department FROM users u
//
// is a correct, documented pair in which Query's bag is a strict SUBSET of
// Fetch's. Warming the fetch cache from it substitutes the DISPLAY projection for
// the authoritative bag, for the whole of the slot's ttl, for every subject the
// listing returned.
//
// The consequence is an access-control change, not a stale read: `principal.teams`
// is then ABSENT rather than wrong, so every membership predicate over it is
// false. In an inclusive grant that denies; in an EXCLUSIVE one a rule that stops
// selecting stops EXCLUDING, so an administrator running
// `aperture attributes query user` silently widens access until the ttl expires,
// and no verdict, trace or note says why. That is the same hazard
// rules.TestAMissingBagWidensAnExclusiveGrant describes, reached from the other
// direction — a bag that is present but shorter.
//
// There is no cheap way to make the warm safe. Aperture cannot compare the two
// projections: an attribute bag is opaque host data, an absent key is
// indistinguishable from a key whose value is genuinely unset (metadataValue maps
// a NULL to an OMITTED field on purpose), and a provider may legitimately answer
// Query from a search index and Fetch from the system of record.
//
// The object Registry.List keeps its warm, and the asymmetry is deliberate: List
// is a DECISION-PATH call whose Fetch follows immediately in the same candidate
// walk, so the warm is paid back within the same decision. Enumerate has no Fetch
// behind it — it is an admin listing rendered to an operator — so the warm bought
// nothing and cost the decision path its bag.
//
// Fields is re-enforced through MatchFields rather than trusted to the provider.
// The object Registry leaves Fields entirely to its provider because there
// Query's answer bounds an authorization; here the registry is the only shared
// place the predicate can be applied identically for every provider, and the
// cost is one map walk over an already-bounded page. A provider that pushes the

// this method never invents them, and a nil return is the correct, complete
// answer for "the host knows nothing about this principal".
//
// # Leniency, and its one deliberate limit
//
// A missing SOURCE is not a failed decision. Two cases yield a nil bag and no
// error:
//
//   - the kind names no principal slot (an empty kind is the live case — a
//     decision path that never had the principal's record in hand), and
//   - the slot has no registered provider (APERTURE_ATTRIBUTE_PROVIDER_UNREGISTERED),
//     or a registered one has no record for this key (APERTURE_NOT_FOUND).
//
// A deployment that wires a user directory and no machine directory must keep
// deciding, and it does: its machine principals evaluate against the floor. This
// mirrors internal/cli's lenientFetcher, which collapses the same two codes for
// object metadata and for the same reason — an absent source must not become a
// non-decision.
//
// Everything else — a directory that is unreachable, a bag the value model
// rejects — surfaces VERBATIM, keeping its code and its registry fixups, and the
// caller treats it as a non-decision. An outage must not read as "this principal
// has no attributes", because that is an authorization change wearing an
// infrastructure failure's clothes.
//
// A key that can never name one subject is a third thing, and it is refused
// rather than collapsed: an empty key, or the account wildcard, is a CALLER that
// has not resolved what it is asking about, not a deployment that chose not to
// wire a directory (see attributeKeyError).
//
// # The asymmetry leniency leaves, which is accepted rather than solved
//
// An absent attribute makes every comparison against it false. That is deny-safe
// in an INCLUSIVE grant, where a rule that fails to select covers nothing — and
// access-WIDENING in an EXCLUSIVE one, where selection means "excluded", so a
// rule that stops selecting stops excluding and the object the exclusion was
// written to withhold becomes covered.
//
// The alternative is worse in the direction that matters more: erroring on an
// absent bag makes a deployment with an unwired slot undecidable for every
// principal of that kind, which is the outage the leniency exists to prevent.
// The mitigation is therefore VISIBILITY, not refusal — a decision trace says
// when a bag came back floor-only — plus `principal.kind`, which is what lets a
// rule author state a rule's dependence on a directory instead of hiding it (see
// rules.principalBag). rules.TestAMissingBagWidensAnExclusiveGrant keeps the
