// Package engine is Aperture's Policy Decision Point (PDP). It answers the
// single authorization question — "may this principal perform this action on
// this object, in this account?" — by resolving the grants that bind to the
// principal's effective subject set with deny-overrides plus a specificity
// tiebreak.
//
// Resolution rule (FR-6, FR-10, FR-11):
//
//   - A grant is a candidate when its permission's action matches the requested
//     action AND its object pattern covers the requested object.
//   - The decision is the effect of the most specific candidate. Specificity is
//     scored by the identity package (more fixed components, fewer/shallower
//     wildcards rank higher).
//   - A strictly more-specific allow carves an exception out of a broader deny
//     (e.g. deny account:acme/** + allow account:acme/project:atlas/** ⇒ atlas
//     is allowed, the rest of acme denied).
//   - At equal top specificity deny wins. This is both the deny-overrides rule
//     and the deterministic final tiebreak, so the result never depends on grant
//     insertion order.
//   - With no candidate the decision is DENY. Default-deny is the floor.
//
// Account isolation: the engine only ever asks storage for grants stamped to the
// request's active account (model.Storage.GrantsForSubjects is account-scoped),
// so a grant bestowed in another account can never influence a decision here.
// The one deliberate exception is a grant stamped to model.AccountWildcard
// ("*"), which GrantsForSubjects returns for every active account — a single
// grant that spans all tenancies (e.g. read documents everywhere). Only a
// system-admin can mint one, and it is the sole crack in the isolation floor.
//
// The "does this grant cover this object?" test is isolated behind the coverer
// seam. In E1 it is a literal identity-pattern match; in E2 a scope resolver
// will produce a grant's object set and swap in behind the same seam without
// touching the resolution logic.
//
// The hot path is allocation-conscious (NFR p99 < 1ms) but deliberately holds no
// cache yet — caching lands in E4-S4. Nothing here precludes it: Check is a pure
// function of storage state plus the request.
