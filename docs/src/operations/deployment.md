# Deployment

**Audience:** operators running Aperture as a long-lived service.

Aperture ships as a single pure-Go binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, no external runtime).
Running it as a service is one command — `aperture serve` — which hand-wires the
whole dependency graph (`storage → engine → service → HTTP handler`) and boots a
`net/http` server exposing the HTTP + Twirp API and the admin UI.

```bash
bin/aperture serve --addr :8080
```

```text
aperture serving on :8080
```

`serve` listens on `:8080` by default and shuts down gracefully on `SIGINT` /
`SIGTERM`, draining in-flight requests within a 10-second window before it
forces the listener closed.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Env source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--addr` | `:8080` | — | TCP address to listen on. |
| `--store` | *(in-memory)* | — | SQLite DSN for the backing store. Empty ⇒ ephemeral in-memory store. |
| `--seed` | *(see below)* | — | Path to a JSON/YAML seed model, applied in full on **every** boot. Empty ⇒ the embedded `acme` example fixture **with no `--store`**, and **nothing at all** with one. |
| `--auth` | `dev` | `APERTURE_AUTH_MODE` | Authenticator adapter: `dev`, `oidc`, or `parsec`. The flag **overrides** the env var. |
| `--enforce-membership` | off | `APERTURE_ENFORCE_MEMBERSHIP` | Deny any decision whose principal is not a member of the active account, before grants are consulted. |
| `--enumerate-limit` | `1000` | `APERTURE_ENUMERATE_LIMIT` | Ceiling one enumeration is bounded by — the number a request with a non-positive `limit` receives, and the number a larger `limit` is clamped down to. Bounds the scope member gather too, so one value governs both. The flag **overrides** the env var; a value that is not a whole number greater than zero — `banana`, `0`, `-5` — fails the boot with `APERTURE_CONFIG_INVALID` naming the setting and the value. |

**A durable `--store` with no `--seed` seeds nothing.** `serve` runs `Setup`,
reads the model that is already in the database, and writes no model rows on
startup. That is what lets a deployment restart without overwriting itself, and
what lets two instances share one database. Passing a `--seed` alongside a
durable `--store` still applies that whole document on every boot — accounts,
principals, roles, groups, grants, rules — so it is a provisioning step, and two
instances pointed at the same database must not both carry it.

`--enumerate-limit` is the one row in that table that is **not** a `serve` flag.
It configures the deployment, so `check`, `enumerate`, `identifiers`, `explain`
and `mcp` carry the same flag and read the same variable, and every one of them
resolves it to the same number the server does. Set it once in the process
environment and the whole binary agrees; set it on `serve` alone and the
container's own `aperture enumerate` would answer a different question from the
service it is inspecting.

The generated, always-current flag table is the
[Command-Line Reference](../reference/cli.md#aperture-serve).

## The backing store (`--store`)

`--store` selects the storage backend:

- **Empty** (the default) → the pure-Go in-memory backend. Ideal for demos, CI,
  and read-only trials; nothing is persisted across restarts.
- **A DSN** → the SQLite backend (`modernc.org/sqlite`, pure-Go, so CGO stays
  off). The DSN is a `modernc.org/sqlite` data source name — a file path or a
  `file:` URL with pragmas, for example:

  ```bash
  bin/aperture serve --store 'file:aperture.db?_pragma=busy_timeout(5000)'
  ```

The SQLite pool is capped at a single connection so writes serialize cleanly
under SQLite's single-writer model. On startup the server runs the embedded
schema (`Setup`) and then loads the model from `--seed` (or the embedded
example) into the store.

## Configuration precedence

Aperture is configured, in order of increasing precedence:

1. **`.env` file** — when you launch through `make`, a `.env` in the working
   directory is loaded and its keys are exported into the environment before the
   binary runs (`include .env; export` in the `Makefile`). This is the dotenv
   convenience; the binary itself simply reads its process environment.
2. **`APERTURE_*` environment variables** — the primary configuration surface.
   The authenticator is built from these via `auth.ConfigFromEnv` (see below).
3. **Command-line flags** — a flag that declares an env source **overrides** that
   env var. For example `--auth oidc` wins over `APERTURE_AUTH_MODE=dev`.

The seed **model** itself is authored as YAML (or JSON) and supplied with
`--seed`; that document also carries the `connections:` and `providers:` wiring
the server turns into a live object-provider registry. Model YAML is data, not
process config — the two are separate.

One deployment consequence of that split: a `kind: sql` provider names its
database through `dsn_env:`, and a **literal `dsn:` in a seed file is refused at
parse**. So each declared connection needs its environment variable exported
where the process runs — the seed file names the variable, the environment holds
the credential. Nothing is dialled at startup (`sql.Open` is lazy and Aperture
does not ping), so a wrong host or password surfaces on the first decision
touching a SQL-backed object-type as `APERTURE_SQL_PROVIDER_QUERY`, not as a
failed boot. See
[Database-backed providers](../concepts/seed.md#database-backed-providers).

### Authentication environment variables

The authenticator adapter maps each request to an Aperture principal. The
default is `dev` (the bearer token *is* the principal id), so `serve` runs with
**no external identity provider** out of the box; `oidc` and `parsec` are opt-in.

| Variable | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `APERTURE_AUTH_MODE` | all | Adapter: `dev` \| `oidc` \| `parsec`. Empty ⇒ `dev`. |
| `APERTURE_AUTH_PRINCIPAL_CLAIM` | oidc, parsec | Verified claim mapped to the principal id (`sub`, `email`, …). Empty ⇒ `sub`. The `dev` adapter ignores it. |
| `APERTURE_OIDC_ISSUER` | oidc | OIDC issuer URL. |
| `APERTURE_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | oidc | Expected token audience. |
| `APERTURE_OIDC_JWKS_URL` | oidc | JWKS endpoint for signature verification. |
| `APERTURE_PARSEC_KEYRING` | parsec | Path to the broker's persisted signing keyring (`keyring.json`) Aperture verifies brokered tokens against. |
| `APERTURE_PARSEC_STATE_DIR` | parsec | Parsec broker state directory. |

An unrecognised `APERTURE_AUTH_MODE` fails the boot with `APERTURE_CONFIG_INVALID`.
The `oidc` adapter performs network discovery at startup, so misconfiguration
there surfaces immediately when `serve` boots.

The `enforce-membership` toggle (`--enforce-membership` /
`APERTURE_ENFORCE_MEMBERSHIP`) is defence-in-depth: a non-member of the active
account is denied *before* any grant is read, which is what lets a single shared
role (manager, analyst, …) be reused across customer accounts without one
account's grants leaking to another's members.

## Manual dependency injection

`serve` builds its graph with **plain constructors — no DI framework** (no
wire/fx/dig). Each layer is a hand-written call:

```text
buildStore(--store, --seed)         # storage backend + schema + seed
  → engine.New(store, …)            # decision engine (+ scope resolution, membership)
    → service.New(eng, …)           # the fully-wired facade
      → server.New(svc)             # HTTP + Twirp handlers + admin UI
        → server.Authenticate(authn, …)   # request → principal middleware
```

The same fully-wired facade the mutation CLI commands build is what `serve` puts
behind a listener — the engine for decisions, the admin gate for tier checks, the
delegation and impersonation services, the append-only audit trail (decisions
sampled at 100 % under `serve` so the demo trail is legible), the rules engine
over a storage-backed rule source, and the seed's declared object providers. A
rule saved through the admin UI takes effect on the next decision with no
separate rule store.

Because the wiring is explicit Go, there is no configuration container to learn:
the constructor order in `internal/cli/serve.go` *is* the deployment topology.
