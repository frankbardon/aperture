# serve

**Audience:** operators running Aperture as a long-lived service.

```text
aperture serve [options]
```

`serve` hand-wires the full dependency graph (`storage → engine → service →
HTTP handler`) and boots a `net/http` server exposing the HTTP + Twirp API and
the admin UI. It shuts down gracefully on `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`, draining
in-flight requests within a 10-second window. This is the same fully-wired facade
the mutation CLI commands build — the server just puts it behind a listener and
an authenticator.

```bash
bin/aperture serve --addr :8080
```

```text
aperture serving on :8080
```

Press `Ctrl-C` to trigger a graceful shutdown (`shutting down...`).

## What the flags control

- `--addr` — the TCP address to listen on (default `:8080`).
- `--seed` / `--store` — the model to serve, exactly as elsewhere (see
  [Global options](global-options.md)). With no `--store`, the server runs
  against an in-memory model seeded from `--seed` or, when that is omitted too,
  the embedded example — the zero-flag demo. With a `--store` DSN and no
  `--seed`, **nothing is seeded**: the server reads the model already in that
  database and writes no model rows on startup. See
  [Booting against a database](#booting-against-a-database) below.
- `--auth` — the authenticator adapter that maps each request to a principal:
  `dev` (the default — the bearer token *is* the principal id, no external IdP),
  `oidc`, or `parsec`. It overrides the `APERTURE_AUTH_MODE` env var. Because the
  default is `dev`, `serve` runs with **no external identity provider** out of
  the box; `oidc` and `parsec` are opt-in.
- `--enforce-membership` — defence-in-depth: deny any decision whose principal
  is not a member of the active account *before* grants are consulted. This lets
  a single shared role (manager, analyst, …) be reused across accounts without
  one account's grants leaking to another's members. Also settable via
  `APERTURE_ENFORCE_MEMBERSHIP`.
- `--enumerate-limit` — the ceiling one `Enumerate` is bounded by: the number a
  request with a non-positive `limit` receives, and the number a larger request
  `limit` is clamped **down** to. It also bounds the scope member gather, so the
  gather and the result cap are one value. Unset leaves the engine on its
  documented default of `1000`. Also settable via `APERTURE_ENUMERATE_LIMIT`; the
  flag wins when both are given.

  ```bash
  bin/aperture serve --enumerate-limit 1500
  APERTURE_ENUMERATE_LIMIT=1500 bin/aperture serve
  ```

  **It is not a `serve` flag.** It describes the deployment, not the server, so
  the same flag and the same variable are carried by `check`, `enumerate`,
  `identifiers`, `explain` and `mcp`, and all of them resolve it identically —
  one binary cannot be configured to answer 1500 over HTTP and 1000 on the
  command line. The wiring lives in the decision stack every command builds, not
  in `serve`'s own options (which hold only `--enforce-membership`, a posture
  that really is the server's alone).

  ```bash
  APERTURE_ENUMERATE_LIMIT=1500 bin/aperture enumerate alice list 'account:acme/**'
  ```

  A value that is not a whole number **greater than zero** fails the command with
  `APERTURE_CONFIG_INVALID` naming the setting and the value it rejected — under
  `serve`, before the store is opened — rather than quietly serving the default.
  That covers `banana`, and it covers `0` and `-5` too: the engine's
  `WithEnumerateLimit` normalises a non-positive bound to the default, which is
  the right answer for a Go embedder passing a computed number and the wrong one
  for a human who typed one. An operator who wrote `-5` would be served `1000`
  while believing otherwise, so the CLI refuses at the boundary what the library
  would have absorbed. To get the default, omit the setting.

## Booting against a database

`serve` with a `--store` DSN and no `--seed` seeds **nothing**. It runs `Setup`
(which creates missing tables and never migrates), reads the model that is
already there, and writes no model rows of its own.

```bash
# A second instance, against a database another process provisioned:
bin/aperture serve --store 'postgres://aperture@db/aperture'
```

This is what makes a long-lived deployment safe and what lets two instances
share one database. Passing a `--seed` alongside a durable `--store` still
applies that document in full, on **every** boot — which is how you provision a
database on purpose, and which two instances pointed at the same database must
not both do, or each restart re-asserts one instance's model over the other's.

```bash
# Provisioning, deliberately and once:
bin/aperture serve --store 'postgres://aperture@db/aperture' --seed ./model.yaml
```

Under `serve`, the facade is wired with everything the other surfaces expect: the
admin gate, delegation and impersonation mutators, the append-only audit trail,
the rules engine over a storage-backed rule source, and the object providers
declared in the seed's `providers:` section. A rule saved through the admin UI
takes effect on the next decision with no separate rule store.
