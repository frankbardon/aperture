// Package toolmeta holds the metadata table for Aperture's MCP tools: the single
// public source of truth for tool identity (name + description). It is imported
// by BOTH the SDK-free mcp/ core (for its catalog and schema reflection) and the
// mcp/gosdk adapter (whose RegisteredTools mirrors Names), so the two never drift.
//
// The package is pure data: it imports NO MCP SDK and no Aperture execution
// package, so it sits at the bottom of the firewall'd dep graph. The firewall
// test covers it alongside the core.
//
// Every tool here is READ-ONLY: the Aperture MCP surface decides (Check /
// Enumerate / Explain), simulates (what-if), and inspects the model. No tool
// mutates — the mutator verbs the no-mutation test bans (put / delete / create /
// update / bestow / revoke / grant / set / remove / write) never appear as a tool
// name. The decision facade's mutators are simply not surfaced.
