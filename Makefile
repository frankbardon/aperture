# test runs the whole suite with NO external services: CI has no containers, so
# every test here passes with no database present. The SQL provider's unit tests
# use a hand-rolled database/sql driver returning canned rows.
#
# The tests that need a live Postgres are GATED and skip by default. They share
# ONE gate, so a single exported DSN runs both against a scratch database (each
# creates and drops the schemas and tables it uses):
#
#   export APERTURE_PG_INTEGRATION=1
#   export APERTURE_PG_DSN='postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db?sslmode=disable'
#   $(GO) test -run TestPostgresIntegration ./seed/
#   $(GO) test -run TestPostgresLive ./storage/postgres/
#   $(GO) test -run TestPostgresLive ./internal/cli/
#
# The second is the storage backend's conformance run: the WHOLE storagetest
# contract against a real server, once unqualified and once pinned to a
# configured schema. CI has no service containers, so it is the only evidence
# storage/postgres behaves like storage/sqlite.
#
# The third is the shared-wiring surface against a real server: the
# `aperture wiring push -> pull -> push` fixed point, the two backends pulling
# and diffing one wiring as the SAME document, the DB-wired boot's refusals, and
# the two-instance proof that an instance wired from the database and one wired
# from the equivalent seed file decide identically. The dialect-parity gates
# cannot reach any of it — they prove the two schemas describe the same database,
# not that a write-then-read through one of them builds the same registries.
#
# The gate is deliberately fail-loud: with APERTURE_PG_INTEGRATION on and no
# APERTURE_PG_DSN the tests FAIL rather than skip, and a value of it that is
# neither on nor off FAILS too, so asking for the run and silently not getting
# one cannot happen. Each suite creates and drops its own schema, so one exported
# DSN drives all three in one shell and leaves no residue. Never put a DSN in a
# file — pass it in the environment.

# bench runs the performance benchmark suite in ./bench (INFORMATIONAL): it

# both ON and OFF, plus the bounded Enumerate benchmark.
#
# The HARD NFR assertion (p99 cached Check < 1ms AND >= 10k checks/sec/instance)
# is the gated test TestCheckNFR, kept out of the default `make test` so a
# loaded CI machine never flakes the build. Run it explicitly:

# vendor-rete regenerates the committed Rete.js bundle at
# internal/server/static/vendor/rete/rete.min.js. This is the ONLY target that
# invokes node, and it is a MANUAL, OCCASIONAL step (version bumps / plugin
# changes) — it is deliberately NOT a dependency of build/test/CI. The normal
# build ships the committed blob and never runs node. All npm work happens in a
# throwaway temp dir (no node_modules/package-lock in the repo). See
# build/rete/build.sh + internal/server/static/vendor/rete/README.md.

# lint runs go vet plus a static analyser when one is available. In a clean
# environment without staticcheck / golangci-lint on PATH the target degrades to
# a notice so `make lint` never hard-fails; CI installs staticcheck explicitly.
#
# "Available" has to mean USABLE, not merely present. The presence test alone
# left one gap wide open: a golangci-lint on PATH that was built with an older
# Go than this module targets refuses to start at all, so the target hard-failed
# in exactly the environment it was written to degrade in — and the failure
# looks like a lint error, which is how it earns a shrug and a "pre-existing"
# label instead of a fix.
#
# golangci-lint separates the two cases by exit code: 1 means it ran and found
# issues (a real failure, propagated), 3 means it could not run at all. Only 3
# degrades, and it degrades LOUDLY — the point of the notice is that nobody
# should be able to read this target's output and think static analysis ran.
