// Package service is the thin decision facade that every surface — the CLI
// check command, the HTTP /check endpoint, and (in E4-S1) the Twirp service —
// calls instead of touching the engine directly. It exists so the surfaces
// share ONE code path with ONE fail-closed policy: the rule for turning an
// engine error into a rendered decision lives here, not duplicated per surface.
//
// Fail-closed rendering (per the engine's error contract):
//
//   - A genuine input-validation error (APERTURE_INVALID_INPUT /
//     APERTURE_IDENTITY_INVALID) is returned to the caller verbatim, so the CLI
//     renders a usage error and HTTP returns 400. The caller asked an
//     ill-formed question; that is not a deny.
//   - Every other engine error (an unknown principal surfaces as
//     APERTURE_NOT_FOUND, a storage fault as APERTURE_STORAGE, ...) is rendered
//     fail-closed as a DENY, with the underlying error folded into the reason.
//     A decision point must never fail open.
//   - A clean engine result passes through unchanged.
//
// E4-S1 note: the Twirp handler should call exactly this facade —
// service.New(eng).Check(ctx, service.Query{...}) returning service.Result — so
// the gRPC/Twirp surface inherits the same fail-closed semantics for free.
//
// Beyond Check the facade exposes the rest of the decision API (FR-10):
// Enumerate (which objects a principal may act on), Explain (the full decision
// trace), and a bulk-batched form of all three. The single ops keep the
// fail-closed contract; the batch ops return per-item results ALIGNED with their
// queries (result[i] for query[i]) so one bad query never fails the batch — the
// shape E4-S1 (Twirp), E4-S3 (MCP), and E6-S4 (what-if) all build on.
//
// Rendering per op:
//
//   - Check / CheckBatch keep the fail-closed contract above (operational error
//     folds to a deny Result; an input-validation error is returned).
//   - Enumerate / Explain return engine errors verbatim. Enumerate cannot fail
//     open by construction — every id it returns is one Check allows, denied
//     objects are excluded inside the engine — so an operational failure is a
//     returned error, not a silent partial set. Explain is a diagnostic.
//   - The batch ops carry each item's error in its BatchResult, so a partial
//     failure is per-item, never whole-batch.
